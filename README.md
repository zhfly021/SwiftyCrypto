We modified some existing problems in project [SwiftyCrypto](https://github.com/Wstunes/SwiftyCrypto), and some methods were deprecated, which affected the normal operation of the project. So, we made some improvements and labeled the changes “FIXME: Deprecated method”. In subsequent tests, these improvements effectively solved the existing problems in project [SwiftyCrypto](https://github.com/Wstunes/SwiftyCrypto).
